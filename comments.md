# settlers4 evaluation

## Project plan

Evaluated earlier, grade: 3.5

## Documentation

Document is clear and contains many pictures (mainly screenshots). The
class diagram is good, but description of functionality and operation
logic is quite minimal.

Grade: 4

## Clarity of Implementation

Naming of types and variables is mostly clear and indentation is
consistent. There is very little inline commentation, and some
commented lines of code have forgotten in that could have been removed
before final submission.

Grade: 3.5

## Functionality

* builds without warnings

* game started working ok, although it was possible to place castle
  partially on top of water. I managed to put settlers collecting
  stuff, and built one building, but then I could build anything more
  after that. I couldn't find a way to know my current stockpile of
  resources, because couldn't built new buildings. This happened also
  on second try. Stupid user or bug?

* valgrind announced multiple memory leaks when exiting

Grade: 3.5

## Testing

Use of unit tests is nice, many game projects don't bother with
them. A bit more could have been written about the tests themselves.

Grade: 4

## Procedures and group work

Work seems to have balanced well between group and timewise. Not much
information about the collaboration, but apparently the group worked
well together. Visa's work was praised by everyone, and git commit log
supports that (even though it would have been easier to assess if you had
used your real names/Emails in git user identification).

Grade: 4.5

## Summary

Overall grade: 3.8
(+ 0.5 adjustment to Visa for above reasons)
